# General
This format is not intended to exchange structured data read and written by machines (like JSON is commonly used as), but rather as a format read and written by people and read by machines (like TOML and YAML).

It should be easy to integrate, which means that a fully specification conformant parser should be easy to write and fairly small.

It's essentially a saner YAML/JSON (for humans) hybrid with a bunch of stuff taken from the TOML spec.

* UTF-8
* keys are case-sensitive
* Newline is LF (0x0A) or CRLF (0x0D 0x0A)
* Whitespace is space (0x20) or tab (0x09)

# Comments
A single-comment starts wherever a `#` occurs wherever it is not part of a double-quoted string and ends with newline, everything between that is a comment

# Key/Value Pair
Key must be string (may be quoted)
```yaml
key2: "value2"
keys are strings and can contain spaces: true
"they may be ::\"quoted\"::, too": true
```
K/V pairs may be separated by newline, or a comma!
```yaml
key1: "value1", key2: "value2"
```

# Null
```yaml
key: null
```

# Strings
```yaml
#str0: double quotes are optional
str1: "Enclosed in double-quotes"
str2: "Escape \"quote\" and backslash \\ with backslash"
str3: "Arbitrary byte sequence with \x00\x01\x02"
strm1: "Multi
Line
String"
strm2: "\ # Trim whitespace with trailing backslash
    Multi \
    Line \
    String\
    "
```

# Numbers
```yaml
num1: +1
num2: 2
num3: -12
num4: 0xbaadf00d
num5: 0o0123567
num6: 0b1110101
num7: +1.0
num8: 3.1415
num9: -0.01
num10: 1e-5
num11: 3E6
num12: 2.77e-3
num13: inf
num14: -inf
num15: nan
num15: -nan
```

# Boolean
```yaml
bool1: true
bool1: false
```

# Array
Surrounded by []. Values separated by newline or comma
```yaml
array1: [1, 2, 3]
array2: ["heterogeneous", 1, "arrays", 2, "are", 3, "fine"]
array3: [
    "trailing",
    "comma",
    "is",
    "fine",
]
array4: [
    "newline"
    "are"
    "sufficient"
    "as"
    "separator"
]
```

# Dictionary
The document itself is a dictionary. Surrounded by {}. Same rules regarding separation
```yaml
point: {x: 1, y: 2}
colors: {
    background: [255, 255, 255]
    text: [0, 0, 0]
}
```

# Open Questions
## Null
* Should simply not defining a value result in a special null value? (e.g. `key1:`). *I don't like this. It makes the parser more complicated and it often looks like a mistake.*
* Should there be a way to represent a special null value explicitly? (e.g. `key1: null`). *Plenty of people are lacking null in TOML, so I shall add it.*
* Should this value be different from the absence of a value? *Yes it should be different, because without it it, there would be less of a point for the whole feature. It gives you the option to "override" stuff as empty.*

## Newlines
* Should CRLF be supported? Probably for practicality reasons, but it's annoying to implement *Yes, Windows exists and Windows users are less likely to know what different line endings are.*

## Strings
* More escape characters? You can do most of them with \x if you have to. But maybe the common/convenient ones (the ones TOML supports: https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string - \b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \", \\. Most of these I have never ever used in over a decade of programming. My subset would be: \t, \n, \r, \", \\)? *Yes, I need more, because people will use them and then they will be confused when that didn't work.*
* Should escaping backlash only be necessary if the following character is not part of a valid escape sequence (so `"oof\oof"` is valid)? I think this is kinda cool, but can lead to sneaky errors, like when typing a windows path: `E:\Users\Joel\directory\notherdir\file` (\n is going to be a newline). *Using \ for an invalid escape sequence should always error. Different languages handle this different, so that the end result could surprise people, which is not good in this case.*
* Should there be literal strings (with single quotes) like TOML has them, where no escaping is performed? *No, I think it's really useful and nice to have, but not at all necessary and no one will ever do this "instinctively" and then be surprised that it doesn't work. Also if you don't quite know the language well enough, finding backslashes in literal strings might just look like a mistake. I might change my mind on this later.*
* Should I have unicode escape sequences? (`\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX`) *The best reason for doing this is that everyone has it and people will be surprised if it's not there and it doesn't add too much complexity by itself.*

## Comments
* Should I allow `//` and `/**/` comments? I'm not quite sure how necessary multi-line comments are. *Every usable editor on the planet will help you do multi line comments trivially. The extra complexity, even if it is very little, cannot be justified. And if there are no C style multi-line comments, there should be no C-style single line comments either.*

## Types / Annotations
I would like to have had type-annotations in the past. Should it be possible to prepend values with a type (`position: (vec2) [0, 0], color: (color) [1, 0, 0]` or `bytes: <hex> "baadf00d"`) and the type name would be saved alongside the value.
If the type name is a builtin type, it will do conversions.
More examples:

```yaml
# Remove limitations of JOML, for example make a dict not allow unique keys
dict: (unique) {
    a: 1
    a: 2 # ERROR!
}

# Annotate how data should be used. For example whether an array should replace values or append to them.
settings: (replace) ["cool", "fancy"]
settings: (append) ["cool", "fancy"]
settings: (prepend) ["cool", "fancy"]

# If the annotation is just a string, you could decide to interpret the annotation as JOML itself.
# How to use annotations in there though? How does the annotation terminate?
# Maybe it should just always be JOML? But then there is no good way to allow simple type annotations (single word without any special characters).
position: (type: "vec2", synchronize: true, precision: "half") {
    x: 0,
    y: 0
}
```

This would be cool, but needs to be justified WELL, because it increases complexity. I am not at all decided on the syntax. I needed this a bunch of times, but I think it's contrary to the goals of this language (low complexity).

# Notes For Later
## Mandatory String Quotation
optional quotation would make this invalid (the comma separator is at fault):
```yaml
key1: this is a sentence, that I really like
key2: something
```

I severely dislike that magic value (like true, false maybe null) can only be identified after being parsed as a string. If you have a subtly malformed number, it would also just be interpreted as a string (e.g. `1Ãª-6` or maybe some invisible unicode codepoints/whitespace in there), when you actually want an error.
